var num = 30; //explicitly defined a data type
var num1 = 34.5; //Taking default data type as number
//typeof - which helps om terms of identify the data type of variable
console.log("Value of num is " + num + " and its type is " + typeof (num));
console.log("Value of num1 is " + num1 + " and its type is " + typeof (num1));
